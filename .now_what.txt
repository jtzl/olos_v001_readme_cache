I dunno, maybe go decrypt that pgp-encrypted file?

Go find the luks volume?  You can probably most easily find the passphrase to
the luks volume with the command line, by the way.  I installed a program on
here to make inspecting image attributes.  Hmm I wonder if I left the apt
history in place...  But now I've said too much.
